# The Randomness Pallet

## Introduction {: #introduction }

Moonbeam utilizes verifiable random functions (VRF) to generate randomness that can be verified on-chain. A VRF is a cryptographic function that takes some input and produces random values, along with a proof of authenticity that these random values were generated by the submitter. The proof can be verified by anyone to ensure the random values generated were calculated correctly. For more information on Moonbeam's on-chain randomness, such as an overview on the randomness sources, the request and fulfill cycle, and more, please refer to the [Randomness on Moonbeam](/learn/features/randomness){target=_blank} overview page.

The randomness pallet enables you to check on randomness requests that have not been fulfilled or purged, randomness results, and more. To actually request and fulfill randomness, you can use the randomness precompile and randomness consumer contracts. The precompile is a Solidity interface that enables you to request randomness, check on the status of requests, fulfill requests, and more through the Ethereum API. For more information on how to use both of these contracts, please refer to the [Randomness Precompile](/builders/pallets-precompiles/precompiles/randomness){target=_blank} guide.

This page will provide an overview of the storage methods and getters for the pallet constants available in the randomness pallet.
