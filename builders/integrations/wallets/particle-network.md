# Particle Network Smart Wallet-as-a-Service

## Introduction {: #introduction }

[Particle Network](https://particle.network){target=\_blank} is a [Smart Wallet-as-a-Service](https://docs.particle.network/getting-started/smart-wallet-as-a-service){target=\_blank} provider that allows developers to improve user experience through modular and customizable Externally Owned Account (EOA) and [Account Abstraction (AA)](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction){target=\_blank} embedded wallet components.

One major component of Particle's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service stack that streamlines user onboarding is [Particle Auth](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service){target=\_blank}, which can be used to onboard users via familiar Web2 accountsâ€”such as Google accounts, email addresses, and phone numbers. This is enabled by using [Multi-Party Computation-based Threshold Signature Scheme (MPC-TSS)](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service){target=\_blank} technology for key management.

For a complete overview of Particle's stack, please check out Particle's blog post: [Introducing Our Smart Wallet-as-a-Service Modular Stack](https://blog.particle.network/announcing-our-smart-wallet-as-a-service-modular-stack-upgrading-waas-with-erc-4337){target=\_blank}.

Particle supports Moonbeam, Moonriver, and the Moonbase Alpha TestNet through both standard EOA interactions and native [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337){target=\_blank} SimpleAccount implementations, facilitating full-stack account abstraction.
  
Specifically, Particle Network's Moonbeam integration is made up of a few components:

- Particle Network [Wallet-as-a-Service](https://docs.particle.network/getting-started/smart-wallet-as-a-service){target=\_blank} - this is the flagship Wallet-as-a-Service product offered by Particle Network, enabling application-embedded wallets powered by MPC-TSS to facilitate a seamless, Web2-like onboarding and interaction experience
- Particle Network Modular [AA Stack](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction){target=\_blank} - beyond the base EOA-centric interaction that happens by default through Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service, Particle also has a native modular AA stack for the implementation of ERC-4337 account abstraction on Moonbeam. This means inherent flexibility with the smart account, bundler, and paymaster you use in tandem with Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service when building AA-enabled applications

## Install Dependencies {: #install-dependencies }

To integrate Particle Network within your Moonbeam application, you'll need to install a number of dependencies, the specifics of which depend on whether you intend on purely using the default EOA generated by Particle's Wallet-as-a-Service, or if you intend to leverage an attached smart account.

For both EOA and smart account utilization, install `@particle-network/auth`.

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @particle-network/auth
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @particle-network/auth
    ```

If you'd like to natively use ERC-4337 AA, also install `@particle-network/aa`.

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @particle-network/aa
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @particle-network/aa
    ```

When creating an AA, you'll need to pass it a provider. You can use a Particle Provider or any EVM wallet provider. To use a Particle Provider, you'll need to install `@particle-network/provider`.

=== "npm"

    ```bash
    npm install @particle-network/provider
    ```

=== "yarn"

    ```bash
    yarn add @particle-network/provider
    ```

## Configure Particle Network {: #configure-particle-network }

With an application made and dependencies installed, you can move on to configuring your project.

To configure your project, you'll need to:

1. Import [`ParticleNetwork`](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service/sdks/web#step-2-setup-developer-api-key){target=\_blank} from [`@particle-network/auth`](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service/sdks/web){target=\_blank}
2. Import `Moonbeam` from [`@particle-network/chains`](https://docs.particle.network/developers/other-services/node-service/evm-chains-api){target=\_blank}, as you'll need Moonbeam's chain name and ID in the next step
3. Initialize `ParticleNetwork` using your project credentials that you retrieved from your dashboard and Moonbeam's chain name and ID, and, optionally, you can configure wallet display and security settings

    !!! note
        You can use [dotenv](https://www.dotenv.org){target=\_blank} to securely store your project credentials.

```js
--8<-- 'code/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/configure-particle.js'
```

## Create an ERC-4337 Account Abstraction {: #create-erc-4337-account-abstraction }

If you want to use an ERC-4337 AA, you'll need to take a couple additional steps:

1. Import `SmartAccount` from [`@particle-network/aa`](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction/sdks/web){target=\_blank} and `ParticleProvider` from [`@particle-network/auth`](https://docs.particle.network/developers/auth-service/sdks/web){target=\_blank}
2. Initialize a `ParticleProvider` to handle wallet connect requests using the `particle` instance you created in the previous set of steps
3. Initialize a [`SmartAccount`](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction/sdks/web#initialize-the-smartaccount){target=\_blank} using the provider, your project credentials, and the AA implementation and configuration. For Moonbeam, you'll use either the `SIMPLE` or `BICONOMY` implementation (if you're using `BICOMOMY`, set `version` to `2.0.0`) and pass in Moonbeam's chain ID
4. Enable ERC-4337 mode, specifying the `SIMPLE` or `BICONOMY` implementation

```js hl_lines="3 4 21-34 37-40"
--8<-- 'code/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/configure-aa.js'
```

At this point, you've signed up and created an application, installed all required dependencies, and configured `ParticleNetwork`, along with `SmartAccount`, if applicable.

### Wrap an EIP-1193 Provider {: #create-a-custom-provider }

You can wrap your AA in a custom provider if you want to interact with an Ethereum library, such as [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6){target=\_blank} or [Web3.js](https://docs.web3js.org){target=\_blank}.

To do so, you'll need to take the following steps:

1. Import [`AAWrapProvider`](https://docs.particle.network/developers/account-abstraction/sdks/web#initialize-the-smartaccount){target=\_blank} from `'@particle-network/aa'`
2. Import the library of your choice
3. Initialize a `AAWrapProvider` using the AA you created in the previous section
4. Wrap the EIP-1193 provider using the library of your choice and the `AAWrapProvider`

=== "Ethers.js"

    ```js hl_lines="4 5 44 45"
    --8<-- 'code/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/custom-ethers-provider.js'
    ```

=== "Web3.js"

    ```js hl_lines="4 5 44 45"
    --8<-- 'code/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/custom-web3-provider.js'
    ```

## Example of Utilization {: #example-of-utilization }

With the aforementioned established, Particle Network can be used similarly, as shown in the example application below.

Specifically, this application creates a smart account on Moonbeam MainNet through social login, then uses it to send a test transaction of 0.001 GLMR.

```js
--8<-- 'code/builders/integrations/wallets/particle/example-app.js'
```

The full demo repository containing the above code can be found in the [particle-moonbeam-demo GitHub repository](https://github.com/TABASCOatw/particle-moonbeam-demo){target=\_blank}.

That concludes the brief introduction to Particle's Smart Wallet-as-a-Service stack and how to get started with Particle on Moonbeam. For more information, you can check out [Particle Network's documentation](https://docs.particle.network){target=\_blank}.
