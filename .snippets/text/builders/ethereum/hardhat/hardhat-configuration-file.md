Next you can take the following steps to modify the `hardhat.config.js` file and add Moonbase Alpha as a network:

1. Import plugins
2. Create a variable for your private key(s)

    !!! remember
        This is for demo purposes only. Never store your private key in a JavaScript file.

3. Inside the `module.exports`, you need to provide the Solidity version
4. Add the Moonbase Alpha network configuration.
