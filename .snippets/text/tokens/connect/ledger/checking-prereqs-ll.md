As of November 29, 2022, the Moonbeam and Ledger Live integration was released, allowing you to send and receive GLMR tokens with your Ledger device directly in Ledger Live. With this integration, you'll no longer need to connect your Ledger to MetaMask. If you prefer this method, please skip ahead to the [Use Ledger Live to Send & Receive GLMR](#use-ledger-live) section of this guide.

If you prefer to use MetaMask as an intermediary between your Ledger device and Moonbeam, make sure that your MetaMask is [connected to Moonbeam](/tokens/connect/metamask/){target=\_blank}.

As of [MetaMask version 10.5.0](https://consensys.io/blog/metamask-and-ledger-integration-fixed){target=\_blank}, connecting your Ledger device with MetaMask on Chrome is easy again. You just need to have the latest version of MetaMask installed.
